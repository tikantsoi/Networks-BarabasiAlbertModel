# Networks-BarabasiAlbertModel

This is a computer simulation of the Barabasi Albert (BA) model as part of the Complexity and Networks course in Imperial College Physics. The BA model is fundamentally driven by a preferential attachment process, meaning more connected vertices in the network are likely to undergo further connections with new vertices, interestingly, such behaviour is helpful in explaining the "richer get richer" theory which is applied in our everyday life from wealth, social influence to modern politics. In this project, we conducted a statistical study of a growing network and at last, presented a more realistic model by making some crucial modifications.
